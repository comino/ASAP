# ASAP
Crappy "As-soon-as-possible" App we created for Hack Zuerich in just a few hours - so please dont judge :P

Everyone hates stinky toilets. And if yoou are new to a city you dont know where to get one! 

Its a App +  Air quality sensor to show you the smell status of public toilets. 
People can put a RYSTA (www.rysta.io) with a Air quality sensor into your pulbic toilet and it will appear in the app as 
a public toilett - and the people can see if its smelly or not!
